                    <ul>
                      <li>You have the right to:</li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          Request access to your Personal Information (commonly
                          known as a “data subject access request”). This
                          enables you to receive a copy of the Personal
                          Information we hold about you and to check that we are
                          lawfully processing it.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Request correction of the Personal Information that we
                          hold about you. This enables you to have any
                          incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you
                          corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy
                          of the new data you provide to us.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Request erasure of your Personal Information. This
                          enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal
                          Information where there is no good reason for us
                          continuing to process it. You also have the right to
                          ask us to delete or remove your Personal Information
                          where you have successfully exercised your right to
                          object to processing (see below), where we may have
                          processed your information unlawfully or where we are
                          required to erase your Personal Information to comply
                          with local law. Note, however, that we may not always
                          be able to comply with your request of erasure for
                          specific legal reasons which will be notified to you,
                          if applicable, at the time of your request.

                          Object to the processing of your Personal Information
                          where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or
                          those of a third party) and there is something about
                          your particular situation which makes you want to
                          object to processing on this ground as you feel it
                          impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You
                          also have the right to object where we are processing
                          your Personal Information for direct marketing
                          purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we
                          have compelling legitimate grounds to process your
                          information which override your rights and freedoms.

                          Request restriction of processing of your Personal
                          Information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the
                          processing of your Personal Information in the
                          following scenarios:

                          <li>
                            where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not
                            want us to erase it;
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            where you need us to hold the data even if we no
                            longer require it as you need it to establish,
                            exercise or defend legal claims; or
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            you have objected to our use of your data but we
                            need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate
                            grounds to use it.

                        <li>
                          Request the transfer of your Personal Information to

                          third party you have chosen, your Personal Information
                          in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable
                          format. Note that this right only applies to automated
                          information which you initially provided consent for
                          us to use or where we used the information to perform
                          on a contract with you.

                          consent to process your Personal Information. However,
                          this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing
                          carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you
                          withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide
